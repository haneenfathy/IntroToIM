# An Instrument from Outer Space

## Idea

For this project, I decided to use the distance sensor to play notes. I chose a random set of notes (around 20) and mapped the distance detected by the sensor to the notes. I used the switch to pause the notes so the user has more control over the music playing. The reason I called this an instrument from outer space is because the sounds that it makes resemble that of a sci-fi movie. The fact that the notes switch so fast too makes it hard so that's why I used the switch to pause between the notes. I also added Led lights that turn on and off based on the distance (also mapped) this makes the whole thing more fun and interactive.
