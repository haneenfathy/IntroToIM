# An Instrument from Outer Space

## Idea

For this project, I decided to use the distance sensor to play notes. I chose a random set of notes (around 20) and mapped the distance detected by the sensor to the notes. I used the switch to pause the notes so the user has more control over the music playing. The reason I called this an instrument from outer space is because the sounds that it makes resemble that of a sci-fi movie. The fact that the notes switch so fast too makes it hard so that's why I used the switch to pause between the notes. I also added Led lights that turn on and off based on the distance (also mapped) this makes the whole thing more fun and interactive.

## Circuit


## Process

1. I drew my schematic first since I have many components this time and I did not want to get lost.
2. I started building my circuit which went really smoothly this time. I think I am becoming much more used to circuit building.
3. I tested each component on the Arduino to make sure everything was in its right place.
4. I added the notes and durations for them. I varied the durations a little bit. I mapped the distance detected by the sensor to each notes and duration.
5. I did the same thing to decide which LED to light up.

## Challenges

I didn't face a lot of challenges in this project in terms of the coding and circuit except for one error I was facing with delay that I managed to fix. Other than that, it took me a really long time to come up with an idea because inlike with processing, I am not sure where to go for project inspiration.
