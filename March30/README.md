# Analog Input and Output: Gentle Alarm Clock


## Idea

For this assignment, I decided to use the light sensor and a switch to control 3 LEDs. I have 2 LEDs that are controlled by 2 switches. One switch is clicked when they wake up and the other switch when it's time to sleep. The intensity of the LEDs between the two clicks varies according to the light (or time of day). In the morning the lights would be off and then get brighter as it gets darker and then starts getting dimmer again to prepare for bedtime. When the nights out switch is clicked the LEDs turn off. When the morning switch is clicked, the lights turn on very dimmly and continue to get brighter throughout the day. This is meant to replicate normal days and nights as to help regulate sleeping cycles better.

I connected the analog light sensor as well as the 2 switches first and made sure they are correctly reading inputs. I then connected the 2 LEDs and made sure they are correctly connected. I tried to build the circuit in a way where it was easy to access the switches.
