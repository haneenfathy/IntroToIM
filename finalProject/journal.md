# Final Project Proposal

## Description

### Creating Virtual Sculptures: A Generative Art Project

My final project idea is to build a processing sketch that creates a sculpture of some sort using input from the Arduino board. This will be a generative art project that will allow the user to interact with project and create their unique artwork. I chose this project because I wanted to take advantage of the arduino sensors to their full capacity and make use of how unreliable the values can be if you're creating a set thing. In this project, you can mess around with the sensors and inputs as much as you want to see how interesting it will turn out to be.

## My Circuit

My circuit will include a photoresistor, potentiometer, distance sensor, and switches. Each will be responsible for a different change in the processing sketch.

## Arduino

My arduino code will configure all of the different inputs and then send over the data to the processing sketch.

## Processing

Most of the heavy lifting will be in the processing sketch. For now, my plan is to create a particle system that changes accordingly to the arduino input. Initially, I wanted to create like a pottery type thing that changes with the input but I think the particle system will be more creative. Depending on how difficult this will turn out to be I will decide how my virtual sculpture will look like. What I know for sure is that I want it to be very creative so it can respond to the changes in the arduino input.
