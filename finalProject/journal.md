# Final Project Proposal

## Description

### Creating Virtual Sculptures: A Generative Art Project

My final project idea is to build a processing sketch that creates a sculpture of some sort using input from the Arduino board. This will be a generative art project that will allow the user to interact with project and create their unique artwork. I chose this project because I wanted to take advantage of the arduino sensors to their full capacity and make use of how unreliable the values can be if you're creating a set thing. In this project, you can mess around with the sensors and inputs as much as you want to see how interesting it will turn out to be.

## My Circuit

My circuit will include a photoresistor, potentiometer, distance sensor, and switches. Each will be responsible for a different change in the processing sketch.

## Arduino

My arduino code will configure all of the different inputs and then send over the data to the processing sketch.

## Processing

Most of the heavy lifting will be in the processing sketch. For now, my plan is to create a particle system that changes accordingly to the arduino input. Initially, I wanted to create like a pottery type thing that changes with the input but I think the particle system will be more creative. Depending on how difficult this will turn out to be I will decide how my virtual sculpture will look like. What I know for sure is that I want it to be very creative so it can respond to the changes in the arduino input. 


### April 15

Wrote my final proposal: creating a virtual sculpture with your Arduino.

Started researching options on how to create the sculptures with processing.

### April 17

Started implementing the virtual sculpture on processing. Faced a lot of technical difficulties.

### April 19

Continued implementing the virtual sculptires by creating shapes that are altered by the sensors. Researched ways of doing things differently as they are not very visually pleasing.

### April 20

Changed my idea and started doing flow fields that are controlled by the sensor values.

### April 22

Found several sketches online that can be adapted into my code. Started trying to create something that looks like the pour art videos.

Built a small sketch inspired by pour art videos and another sketch that uses circle to create overlapping shaoes in interesting ways.

### April 25

Finished the handshaking process after realizing I had some bugs (I probably accidentaly changed something along the way)

### April 27

I struggled a lot today finding ways to use the sensor values most interestingly with my sketch. I spent most of the day experimenting to find ways I can have the sensor values affect the sketch. I found a coyple of ways but I am still undecided between them.


### April 28

Implemented the things I decided in yesterday. I only had a few things left today so I created the homepage but unfortunately didn't have time to make it as nice looking as I wanted. I also finalized the code. I had some problems where when I start playing one game the other strats and vice versa. This took most of time today but I managed to fix it by having a restart boolean variable that restarted everything between the games.
