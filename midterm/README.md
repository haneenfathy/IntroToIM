# INTRO TO IM: MIDTERM PROJECT

## The Letters Race

### Introduction

My idea for my midterm was to create a language learning game. Initially, I wanted the game to be a race where the user races to collect letters. A word would pop up on the screen in a language, and then the user would collect the letter of the word's meaning in english, testing himself on the langauge. After some work, I found it easier if the user would simply control an object that goes left and right to try and collect the letters as they fall down which is a little bit different from a racing game. 
My final design was very similar. I ended up using an image of a paper that the user moves left and right, following the mouse and collects the letters that correspond to the word on the screen.
In each level, a word appears on the screen in Arabic. The objective of the user is to collect the letters that form the English translation of the word to test their knowledge of Arabic vocab.

### Game Instructions

When you first launch the game you are faced with a home screen. Upon clicking start, the game starts. To control the game you move your mouse left and right to move the piece of paper.
On the top left corner of the screen, you have an Arabic word that you're supposed to figure out the meaning of. To test your knowledge, you move the paper to collect the letters that make up the word
